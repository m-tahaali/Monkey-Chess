        Welcome to Monkey Chess!
        <br><br>
        In this game, the main goal is to capture both the enemy King and enemy Queen, putting them in jail. To achieve
        this, you need to know the rules of the game and how each piece works.
        <br><br>
        Let me explain the rules of the game to you:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Fish:</b> This piece can move one space in any direction except backwards and can only take pieces on a
            diagonal.
            When it reaches the end of the board, it becomes a Fishy Queen.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Elephant:</b> The Elephant moves exactly two spaces in each diagonal direction and takes only the piece
            landed
            on.
            It cannot jump over pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rook:</b> This piece can move to any free space on the board and can only take pieces exactly one space
            from it
            horizontally or vertically. Pieces can only be taken by the Rook if a friendly piece was taken the previous
            turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Monkey:</b> The Monkey can move exactly one space horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and can swing
            over
            pieces.
            If there is any piece of any color where a Monkey can normally move, it will swing over the piece, placing
            the
            Monkey on the other side of the piece. As long as there are pieces to swing over, the Monkey can swing
            forever.
            If an enemy piece is on the other side, that piece is taken. Monkey swinging ends when a piece is taken or
            when
            its space is double-clicked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fishy Queen:</b> This piece can move any amount in any direction horizontally, diagonally or vertically.
            There
            are
            no special conditions when it is taken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Queen:</b> This piece can move any amount in any cardinal or diagonal direction. If captured, the player
            who
            captured it puts it in jail on their right of the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>King:</b> This piece can move one space in any cardinal or diagonal direction. If captured, the player
            who
            captured
            it puts it in jail on their right of the board. The King starts the game holding the banana. While holding a
            banana, the King can be saved by the Monkey. If the Monkey is adjacent to the King's jail space, it can
            swing
            horizontally into the jail space, rescuing the King. The King loses the banana when this happens and can
            never
            recover it. The Monkey must be able to continue swinging after this, or the King cannot be saved. This does
            not
            apply to the Queen as she does not have a banana.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Bear:</b> This piece can be controlled by both players and starts the game in the center of the board,
            where
            D4/E5
            intersect. It can move to D4, D5, E4 or E5 on its initial movement, and otherwise moves one space in any
            cardinal or horizontal direction. Note that the Bear cannot take pieces, but can be taken and swung over.
          </li>
        </ul>
